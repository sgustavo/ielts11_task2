There is a claim that instead of the educational system waste a considerable amount of time with theory tuition, it should be more focus on teaching students how to solve real world problems. I completely agree with this opinion for two reasons.

Firstly, the education methodology did not evolve enough to provide an adequate knowledge for the people. Pupils are constantly learning about subject that will not help them to achieve goals, increase their abilities and consequently a lifetime will be lost with unnecessary information. Math is one example of a subject presented in the education curriculum that did not develop its approach and day-by-day it is getting even worse. The formulas, equations, diagrams, are very confuse and the majority of people tend to memorize its concepts instead to understand them. 

Secondly, a lack of financial education hampers adolescents and adults. Institutions should include personal finance classes in the academic curriculum with practical activities aiming the issues that many families face nowadays. For instance, the Brazilian soccer player Manuel Francisco, as known as Man√© Garrincha, was one of the most well paid athletes in his time however, he faced many financial troubles due the fact that he was not able to manage his incomes.
