There is a claim that instead of the educational system waste a considerable amount of time with theory tuition, it should be more focus on teaching students how to solve real world problems. I completely agree with this opinion for two reasons.

Firstly, the education methodology did not evolve enough to provide an adequate knowledge for the people. Pupils are constantly learning about subject that will not help them to achieve goals, increase their abilities and consequently a lifetime will be lost with unnecessary information. Math is one example of a subject presented in the education curriculum that did not develop its approach and day-by-day it is getting even worse. The formulas, equations, diagrams, are very confuse and the majority of people tend to memorize its concepts instead to understand them.

Secondly, a lack of financial education hampers young people nowadays. Institutions should include personal finance classes in the academic curriculum with practical activities in order to increase the studentâ€™s self-management skills. For instance, the Brazilian soccer player Adriano, as known as "The Imperator", was one of the most well paid athletes five years ago and now he is facing many financial troubles due the fact that he was not able to manage his incomes and moreover the breach of many contracts with some football clubs.

To sum up, it is clearly that an educational reform is needed because of the time consuming presented in the scholarship curriculum and the consequences of unprepared adults to deal with the life challenges.
